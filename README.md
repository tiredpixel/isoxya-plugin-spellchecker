# Isoxya plugin Spellchecker

Isoxya plugin Spellchecker provides spellchecking capabilities to entire websites, even if they have millions of pages, and supports 7 languages. It is a plugin for [Isoxya](https://www.isoxya.com/) web crawler.

## Languages

| Code     | Language | Variants               |
-----------|----------|------------------------|
| `en` `*` | English  | `gb` (BrE), `us` (AmE) |
| `cs`     | Czech    | `cz`                   |
| `de`     | German   | `de`                   |
| `es`     | Spanish  | `es` (European)        |
| `et`     | Estonian | `ee`                   |
| `fr`     | French   | `fr`                   |
| `nl`     | Dutch    | `nl`                   |

`*`: this is the default, if no language or variant is specified

Many other languages can be added easily, since both Hunspell and MySpell dictionaries are used. If it's available in the build OS, it can probably be added, with appropriate tests and extensions to the Isoxya engine interface.
